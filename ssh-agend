- Enable ssh-agent (start the ssh-agent in the background)

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent)"
```


-  Add the your private ssh key to the ssh-agent.

```bash
ssh-add ./[your pem file name]
```


- connect to the ec2 in public Subnet
- if we don't want to create a config file, we have another option, using -A flag with the ssh command.
   `-A` option `enables forwarding of the authentication agent connection`. 
    It means that, it forwards your SSH auth schema to the remote host. So you can use SSH over there as if you were on your local machine.

```bash
ssh -A ec2-user@ec2-3-88-199-43.compute-1.amazonaws.com
```


- once logged into the bastion host/jump box, connect to 
the ec2 instance in the private subnet 


```bash
ssh ec2-user@[Your private EC2 private IP]
```
